# Object Identification and Edge Detection System

 This system detects objects in images, retrieves their outer edge coordinates, and analyzes shapes using contour-based techniques in OpenCV.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Identifies various shapes (e.g., circles, polygons) in input images.
- **Edge Coordinate Extraction**: Retrieves precise outer edge coordinates of detected objects.
- **Contour Analysis**: Uses OpenCV's contour iteration to analyze object geometry and improve detection accuracy.
- **Output Generation**: Saves annotated images with highlighted edges.
